Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document
 (RASD).
 The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system in
 terms of functional and non-functional requirements, analyse the real need
 of the customer to modelling the system, show the constraints and the limit
 of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after
 the development.
 This document is intended to all developer and programmer who have to implement
 the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate other system
 with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between the customer
 and the developer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will project and implement SmartCityAdvisor, which will be a software
 system that, using a web/mobile app, will provide the following features
 to the city of Milan and to its citizens:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the level of CO2 is too high or in case of any special situation managed
 by the control center (e.g., the arrival of some VIP, an accident, â€¦), the
 system limits the traffic that enters in the city center by diverting it
 through paths that avoid the center.
 This is done both by controlling the traffic lights and by alerting the
 citizens through the app and through some large displays that are installed
 at the main entrances of the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When a citizen signals through the app that he/she has to go to an emergency
 room, provide suggestions on which hospital to choose based on: i) the
 problem of the citizen and the specializations available in the hospitals,
 ii) the status of queues in the various emergency rooms, iii) the location
 of the citizen and iv) the situation of traffic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To provide this features, SmartCityAdvisor will use informations that the
 city of Milan receives from the Data Control Center of the city, that collects
 data from some sensors that have been installed in the territory.
 This sensors acquire data about:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
level of CO2 in the air;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
cars that enter in the city center;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
availability of parking places in all areas in the city center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the sensors, the city has also installed proper actuators that control
 the traffic lights at the main intersections in the city.
 The actuators are controlled by the Traffic Control Center of the city,
 which also deals with the management of the displays installed at the main
 entrances of the city.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the city has established agreements with the main hospitals in
 the territory to know in real-time the length of the queues in their emergency
 rooms, and with ATM (the public transport company) to know in real-time
 the position and current schedule of all public transports in the city.
